FUTURE IDEAs:

<USERNAME>'s Gallery

Picture generator from an api, where the user will have the option
to add to their gallery, and then the site will handle the upload to the database

INTEGRATE GPT API INTO CODE SOMEHOW

LATER: RESTRICT FILE SIZE UPLOAD FOR SUPABASE STORAGE BUCKETS. GO TO SUPABASE TO DO THIS. ALSO
FILE TYPE

I'm thinking instead of doing a signup form allow the user to enter there data once they
confirm there email

browser as guest option

for gallery im thining have list then option to expand image to fill screen like modal
